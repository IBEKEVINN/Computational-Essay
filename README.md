# Quantum-Dot-Model

In this report, we numerically solve both the time-independant and time-dependant Schrodinger equation (TISE, TDSE respectively) 
via python to model the behaviour of a semiconductor particle called a 'Quantum Dot' (QD). Quantum dots most notably have the 
ability to be used as a single-electon transistor, allowing it to have a wide array of applications in solid-state electronics 
and has been an important research area for quantum computing. 

The model is solved using the finite difference method and is based on the hamiltonian of the Schroedinger Equation.
